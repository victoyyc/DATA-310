#### Question #1
Machine Learning is to feed data and labels to the data to a machine and let it figure out the rules between the data and the labels. The difference between 
traditional programming and machine learning is that traditional programing inputs the data and rules and output the answers, while machine learning takes 
in data and the answer to establish rules. Traditional programming is hardcoded to perform certain functions while machine learning learns how to behave 
over time using the input data.

#### Question #2

[22.003485] [22.000023]

They are different because the neural network deals with possibilities and take guesses, so the results may not be exact. The loss value of both results are not zero so there are some variations. 
  

#### Question #3

The houses at Hudgins, Mathews and Mobjack are good deals because their price is lower than the predicted price for the number of bedrooms they have. The house at New Point Comfort is the worst deal because it is substantially higher priced that the predicted price.
