1. In Laurence Maroneyâ€™s video, What is ML, he compares traditional programming with machine learning and argues that the main difference between 
the two is a reorientation of the rules, data and answers. According to Maroney, what is the difference between traditional programming and machine learning?

Machine Learning is to feed data and labels to the data to a machine and let it figure out the rules between the data and the labels. The difference between 
traditional programming and machine learning is that traditional programing inputs the data and rules and output the answers, while machine learning takes 
in data and the answer to establish rules. Traditional programming is hardcoded to perform certain functions while machine learning learns how to behave 
over time using the input data.

2. With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31. Modify 
the predict function to produce the output for the value 7. Do this twice and provide both answers. Are they the same? Are they different? Why is this so?

[22.003485] [22.000023]

They are different because the neural network deals with possibilities and take guesses, so the result is not exact.
  

3. Using the script you produced to predict housing price, take the provided six houses from Mathews, Virginia and train a neural net model that estimates 
the relationship between them. Based on this model, which of the six homes present a good deal? Which one is the worst deal? Justify your answer. 

The houses at Hudgins, Mathews and Mobjack are good deals because their price is lower than the predicted price for the number of bedrooms they have. The house at New Point Comfort is the worst deal because it is substantially higher priced that the predicted price.
